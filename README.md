<p align="center">
A front-end web application allowing users to draw cards by clicking a button. It displays the number of remaining cards at the top. Whenever two cards match in either value or suit, it would show a message such as "SNAP VALUE!" or "SNAP SUIT!". When the deck runs out (no remaining cards), the button would disappear and be replaced by statistics showing the total number of matches for both value and suit.
